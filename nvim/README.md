# Dependencies

The following dependencies will need to be manually installed (until I get motivated enough to automate it)

- brew install the_silver_searcher
  - https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher
- gem install starscope
  - https://github.com/eapache/starscope
- brew install codequery
  - https://github.com/ruben2020/codequery
- brew install --HEAD universal-ctags/universal-ctags/universal-ctags
  - https://github.com/universal-ctags/homebrew-universal-ctags

You'll also want to use a patched nerd font

Finally, make a `local.vim` file

`touch local.vim`
